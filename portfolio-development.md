Your portfolio is a living document. This means that you develop it gradually and continually.

### Showing Work for the First Time

It's natural that you may feel intimidated showing your work for the first time. That's why it's a good idea to do it as soon as possible. See [this page for more on this](portfolio-feedback.html). This means you should start some time in second year. By then you have pieces that reflect your skills, talent, and your potential.

Don't put off showing your work out of nervousness. Dive in. After the first time, you'll come to find that it's easy and even enjoyable.

Listen to everyone. Take notes. Make revisions. Devise your own path that best reflects you as a designer.

### Show it In Its Native Format

Show each piece in its native form. If you have a motion piece, have it rendered to play locally and upload to YouTube or to Vimeo so they can see it when they wish. If you have a print piece, photograph it and print it. You get the idea. Web designs in the browser, locally and online.

Never rely on the internet access. Have each piece on your computer and online.

### Keep It Updated

As stated at the top of this page, your portfolio is a living document. When you complete your next killer project, be sure to include it in your portfolio. Eventually, you'll have enough pieces that you'll be able to include certain ones to tailor it to a specific employer.
