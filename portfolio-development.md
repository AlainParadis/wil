Your portfolio is a living document. This means that you develop it gradually and continually. Eventually, you'll have a repository of dozens of pieces from which you can choose for specific presentations.

### Showing Work for the First Time

It's natural that you may feel intimidated showing your work for the first time. That's why it's a good idea to do it as soon as possible. See [this page for more on this](portfolio-feedback.html). This means you should start some time in second year. By then you have pieces that reflect your skills, talent, and your potential.

Don't put off showing your work out of nervousness. Dive in. After the first time, you'll come to find that it's easy, constructive, and even enjoyable.

Listen to everyone. Take notes. Make revisions. Show reviewers your progress. Devise your own path that best reflects you as a designer.

### Show it In Its Native Format

Show each piece in its native form. If you have a motion piece, have it rendered to play locally and upload to YouTube or to Vimeo so they can see it when they wish. If you have a print piece, photograph it and print it. You get the idea. Web designs in the browser, locally and online.

Never rely on the internet access. Have each piece on your computer and online.

### Keep It Updated

As stated at the top of this page, your portfolio is a living document. When you complete your next killer project, be sure to include it in your portfolio. Eventually, you'll have enough pieces that you'll be able to include certain ones to tailor it to a specific employer.

### How Many Pieces?

How many pieces to include in your portfolio is a common question to which there's no single answer. One important criteria is that each piece is a source of great pride for you. You should want to brag about each one to everyone you know. A maximum number is about a dozen. More than that gets a bit long to present at once.

That said, with time, you may have dozens of pieces in a portfolio repository from which you can choose for any single presentation. This takes time to build. It should be a long-term goal.
