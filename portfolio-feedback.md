title: Portfolio Development
---
This unofficial summer assignment is designed to help you kickstart your professional network to gain valuable insights for building your portfolio. By reaching out to professional designers and [recent grads](index.html#grads), you'll receive expert advice on your current work and guidance for your future career in graphic design.

### The Objective

Connect with professional designers to receive feedback on your current projects and advice on building a strong portfolio.

### The Process

#### Identify Designers
Research and create a list of designers you admire, whose work aligns with your interests. If you can't find their e-mail address, connect with them on LinkedIn.

#### Prepare Your Work
Gather 3-5 of your best design projects from school assignments or personal work. Create a multi-page PDF file with each piece. If you have print pieces, also bring them printed. If you have motion, render it out to a video file. You can show web designs running locally in the browser. Avoid depending on wifi for your meeting.

These are sites you can use to post your work without having to build your own:

-   [Behance.net](https://www.behance.net/)
-   [Adobe Portfolio](https://portfolio.adobe.com/)
-   [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com)
-   [SqareSpace](https://www.squarespace.com)
-   [Wix](https://www.wix.com)

#### Craft Your Email
Write a professional email to request a meeting. <a href="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/downloads/e-mail-template.txt.zip" title="Download sample text">This text file</a> is a starting point for your message to a pro you wish to meet. You should personalize it to make it sound more like you. You should also connect with each designer on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/). When you do so, *always* include a message in the note area in the invitation. Once you're connected, it will give you an opportunity to stay in touch. Feel free to comment on their posts to keep the connection alive.

#### Prepare for the Meeting
If a designer agrees to meet, prepare questions about portfolio building, industry trends, and career advice.

#### Take notes
Note suggested changes to your work during the meeting. If you see multiple designers, you may find that you get contradicting advice. Take it all in. Craft the path that suits you best.

#### Follow Up
Send a thank-you email expressing your appreciation for their time and insights. If you make changes to your work, you should share with them to keep the conversation going.

Other Summer Activities

In addition to building your portfolio, you can seek out local events to attend to network with practicing designers. There's [Creative Mornings](https://creativemornings.com/cities/ott), [Ottawa Design Club](https://www.ottdesign.club), and [others](https://www.eventbrite.ca).

### The Benefits

By doing this, you'll gain professional feedback on your work and learn about industry expectations for portfolios. It will also build your professional network, which will support your preparation for fieldwork opportunities in level 6

Remember, this is a self-directed assignment for your professional development. It's obviously not graded, but the benefits to your career can be significant. [I will be available](mailto:paradia@algonquincollege.com) throughout the summer if you need advice or support. By taking on this initiative, you're demonstrating professionalism and dedication to your craft â€” qualities that will serve you well in your design career.
