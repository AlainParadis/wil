It's often difficult to define where a design project starts and finishes. If we take a web site as an example, the number of pages and the site functionality can be quite nebulous. Are page templates needed? Is database functionality needed? All this needs to be clearly defined.

### The RFP

The *Request for Proposal* is a document which comes from the client, asking the design firm to submit a proposal for a given project. It will contain what the client is asking for. They're a source of work for design firms. There are public lists to which design firms may subscribe so they automatically receive RFPs from companies or government. They're usually issued by larger organizations. A mom and pop shop wouldn't bother writing a request for a proposal. The designer would simply meet with them to assess their needs.

When a design firm receives an RFP, it's important that they comply with what's requested in quality, in length, in detail and in time. If a response proposal doesn't adhere to what was requested, it can be eliminated from contention outright.

### Proposals

A proposal is a descriptive document. It establishes the scope of work, timelines, the cost of the work, terms for payment and other legal terms. It can be a very long document, depending on the project.

The document itself will be branded with the designer's brand. It can include such things as mood boards, design references, type samples, photography treatments, etcâ€¦

A proposal can also include information about the design firm to ensure they are qualified to complete the requested work. A company history, employee profiles, areas of specialization can all be part of the proposal.

These are some elements included in proposals;

- a cover page, including all contact information,
- a cover letter summarizing and delivering a sales pitch. Choose us!
- a profile of the design firm, including experience,
- a response to the RFP using their terms and language,
- mandatory elements requested in the RFP,
- technical requirements,
- all proposals should be tailored to the RFP

Whether you're responding to an RFP, or simply writing a proposal based on a client interview, it's essential that the document responds directly to the needed work.

### The Design Brief

Great work starts with a great brief. The brief is the specific document which describes the requested work. Briefs are needed for all projects, whether part of a formal RFP process or not, The point is to avoid surprises. It can be a written document, or part of a verbal interview process.

Purpose:

- Set up two-way communication
- Ask questions
- Guide discussion
- Align expectations
- Introduce process

### Quotes

A quote is generally a shorter document which relates more directly on the cost of the project.

If the title of the document is *Quote*, the price is expected to be respected by both parties. If it's titled *Estimate*, it's just that, an estimated price.

### Invoices

The invoice requests payment from the client, based on the directives in the proposal, the quote or the estimate.
